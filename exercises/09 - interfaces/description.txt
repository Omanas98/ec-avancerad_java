Hereâ€™s a basic setup of classes and an interface for vehicles. Use this to answer the following question about interfaces.

1. What methods do you need to add to each of Car and Bicycle to get this code fragment to compile (setting aside the missing constructors)?

2. Does having a class implement an interface change how you write its constructor?

3. Should builtBefore be added to the IVehicle interface? Why or why not?

4. In the Examples class, you want to define a Bicycle as follows:

  ___________ newKidsBike = new Bicycle(0, 1);

Which types can you use in the blank line (without causing a compile error just with this single line)?

5. Assume you defined a Car object as follows:

  IVehicle oldCar = new Car(200000, 1995, 2);

Which methods can you call on oldCar, given the type that you gave it?

6. Assume you defined a Car object as follows:

  Car oldCar = new Car(200000, 1995, 2);

Which methods can you call on oldCar, given the type that you gave it?
